Note
----
1.
For tests to run, the input files must be present in c:\data\dvpr
For confidentiality reasons, the files are not included in the repository.

2. As the files evolve over time, the test may break.

3. It can be considered to highlight missing test case properties

4. "Test No" is in many cases written into the documents as fragments (invisible to the eye) which causes spaces to appear in extracted test cases. Should they be removed?
